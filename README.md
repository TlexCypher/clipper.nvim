# clipper.nvim
**clipper.nvim** is the Neovim plugin to enhance Neovim's clipboard functionality.
clipper keeps track of **your yank history** and allowing you to access it through **Harpoon-like UI**.

clipper.nvim keeps a history of your past yanks, allowing you to easily pick and reuse previously copied text through an intuitive UI.

You donâ€™t need to do anything specialâ€”just yank as usual, and clipper.nvim will automatically record your yank history.

To access your past yanks, simply open clipper.nvimâ€™s dialog by running the clipper command. 
Navigate through your history and press Enter on the item you want to use. This will register it in both Neovimâ€™s " register and the 0 register, so you can paste it instantly with p.

It feels like having an infinite clipboard at your fingertips. Give it a try and see the magic for yourself! ðŸš€

## Installation and dependencies
You can install **clipper.nvim** with major package manager, for instance Lazy.nvim.
#### Lazy.nvim ####
```lua
{
  "TlexCypher/clipper.nvim",
  lazy = false, -- lazy should not be true.
  dependencies = { -- this is dependency for ui.
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
  },
  config = function()
    require("clipper").setup()
  end
}

```
## Configuration
Basically, no more configuration is necessary.
But you can change window size, and callback function when you hit enter on the window.
Below is a brief example.

```lua
{
  "TlexCypher/clipper.nvim",
  lazy = false, -- lazy should not be true.
  dependencies = { -- this is dependency for ui.
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
  },
  config = function()
    require("clipper").setup({
        -- available options are here.
        win_width = 80,
        win_height = 20,
        -- see plenary.nvim documentation.
        borderchars = {"******", "#########"}
        -- default is true.
        -- If yank_only is true,copied contents by pressing d, c key etc are not registered.
        yank_only = false, 
        callback = function() do
        -- your desire when hit the enter on the plenary.nvim based dialog.
        end
    })
  end
}
```
